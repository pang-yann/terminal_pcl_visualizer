# Terminal PCL Visualizer

A high-performance, real-time 3D Point Cloud visualizer for your terminal. Built with ROS 2 and [FTXUI](https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/ftxui), it allows you to visualize point clouds directly from your CLI.

## Features

-   **High-Density 3D Rendering**: Real-time projection of point clouds using Braille characters for maximum resolution.
-   **Adaptive Splatting**: Dynamically fills gaps in sparse point clouds based on depth to provide a solid scene structure from all angles.
-   **Z-Buffering**: Correct depth occlusion ensures closer points properly hide points behind them.
-   **Full-Screen Adaptive UI**: Automatically scales the 3D canvas to fit your terminal window.
-   **Zero-Latency Performance**: Optimized C++ rendering pipeline with pre-calculated trigonometry and memory-efficient buffering.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
-   ROS 2 (Humble or newer recommended)
-   C++17 compiler
-   `sensor_msgs`, `rclcpp`

### Build
```bash
cd ~/your_ws/src
git clone <repository_url>
cd ..
colcon build --packages-select terminal_pcl_visualizer --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
source install/setup.bash
```

## Usage

Run the visualizer node:
```bash
ros2 run terminal_pcl_visualizer visualizer_node
```

### Parameters
-   `topic`: The PointCloud2 topic to subscribe to (default: `/points`).
-   `max_points`: Maximum points to render per frame for performance (default: `20000`).

Example using a camera point cloud topic:
```bash
ros2 run terminal_pcl_visualizer visualizer_node --ros-args -p topic:=/camera/points
```

## Controls

### Camera Control
| Key | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| **W / S** | Orbit Up / Down (Pitch) |
| **A / D** | Orbit Left / Right (Yaw) |
| **P / ;** | Roll Clockwise / Counter-clockwise |
| **+ / -** | Zoom In / Out |
| **Arrows** | Pan Left/Right/Up/Down |
| **PgUp/PgDn**| Move Forward / Backward |
| **1 / 2 / 3**| Camera Presets (front / side / top) |
| **R** | Reset Camera & Splatting |
| **C** | Toggle Camera Mode |

### Visual Quality
| Key | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[** | Decrease Splatting (less gap filling) |
| **]** | Increase Splatting (more gap filling) |
| **Q / Esc** | Quit |
